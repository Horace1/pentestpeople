# Ticket Management System

## Overview

In this project, I've developed a ticket management system that generates tickets using command-line inputs. The system stores essential information, including:

- Ticket Subject
- Ticket Content
- User Name
- User Email
- Timestamp
- Status set to 0

When executing the command, the system integrates the provided data into the ticket table. Additionally, I've implemented a command to process tickets, changing their status from false to true in chronological order, classifying them as processed tickets.

I have also created API endpoints:

- /tickets/open: Displays unprocessed tickets with a status set to false.
- /tickets/closed: Shows processed tickets with a true status.
- /users/{email}/tickets: Retrieves and displays tickets associated with a specific user email.

Furthermore, I have created a stats endpoint that displays:

- Total number of tickets in the database
- Total count of unprocessed tickets
- Name of the user who submitted the highest number of tickets, identified by email
- Timestamp of the last processed ticket.

Additionally, I have implemented unit tests covering various aspects, such as class existence, method existence, and instance of.
